IP-Unique for perl
======================

IP::Unique is my first C++ perl module, and I'm quite happy with it. There are some known issues
(see BUGS in the POD documentation), but all things considered, it has helped to solve one problem 
I've had, and I hope it works for you as well.  Comments and patches are welcome.
